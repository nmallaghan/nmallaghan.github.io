Myself and a number of other PhD students in the Astrophysics Research Centre at QUB hosted a seminar covering a broad range of DEI related topics, such as unconscious bias and imposter syndrome. Afterwards, we hosted a discussion on all of the topics that allowed both students, researchers and academics to engage in a peer-to-peer chat about the issues faced in academia.
