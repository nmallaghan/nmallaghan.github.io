I'm a second year PhD student at the Astrophysics Research Centre, Queen's University Belfast, where I am supervised by Dr. Ernst de Mooij. I'm interested in the discovery and characterisation of giant exoring systems, such as [J1407b](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/126) and [ASASSN-21js](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/08/aa50288-24/aa50288-24.html). However, through this work I am often working on strangely shaped or incredibly deep transit curves that cannot be explained by a normal planet or star transiting in front of the host star. In particular, my research has focused on an object nicknamed the Dusty Object in Orion, which is a short period circumsecondary disk candidate. Another side interest of mine is the effects of stellar activity and variability on the detection and characterisation of exoplanets.

I obtained my undergraduate integrated Masters (MPhys) from Queen's University Belfast in 2023. My disseration project was based on using Sun-as-a-star observations from the HARPS-N telescope to determine the effects that stellar activity (particularly flares and coronal mass ejections) have on stellar activity indicators, such as the H-alpha emission line and LogR'hk.

Outside of research I'm involved in a number of DEI and outreach related activities. In 2022, I co-founded the QUB Women in STEM Society and over the past three years have served as both Secretary and President, before stepping down this summer to focus on entering the final year of my PhD. I am also heavily involved with the DEI committee in our research department, as well as helping to deliver a number of outreach talks and workshops both within and outside of the university. 

In the coming months I will be applying for postdoc positions so please feel free to reach out if my research interests you at all!
