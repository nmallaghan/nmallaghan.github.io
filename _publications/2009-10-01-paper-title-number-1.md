excerpt: 'This paper focuses on an enigmatic transiting object in Orion which shows a deep and asymmetric light curve. I investigated a number of hypotheses to aid in the characterisation of it, including modelling, MCMC fitting and analysing the results. I led the simulations, analysis, and writing up of this work. This paper is currently in prep.'
